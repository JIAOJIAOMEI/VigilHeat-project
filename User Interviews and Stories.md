# Summary of the user interviews
We have conducted a user interview with two people in leading positions from the company Kispatak 2000. They expressed their interest in our project as well as providing a multitude of ideas and suggestions for the feutures of our product.

Our findings approved our hypotheses that recieving information about areas of low and high traffic inside a store would be of value to a retail owner. Our interviewees expalined that they could use this information for improving the layout of their shop, for example, they would leave a larger open space in areas of high traffic and a smaller space where the traffic is generally lower. They could also recognize areas that fall out of the route of a typical costumer, meaning that the products in that area are less likely to be sold. With this information they could rearrange the store in such a way that would make costumers reach all parts of the store more equally.

In addition to this, they have also provided some new ideas about ways we could expand on the functionalities of our product. They were interested to use our sotware to improve the security of their stores. One of the exaples they gave was that in case of something being stolen from the shop they would like our software to be able to find the frame in the video footage when that item disappeared from the shelf. They would also like our software to be able to follow the person who took that item through multiple cameras, generating their complete trajectory in the shop.

They were also interested in detecting products being stolen by not being shown to the cashier (either leaving them in they basket, or putting them down on the ground and pushing it through the checkout).

Lastly, they suggested that another use-case for our product could be detecting the number of people in the queues behind the cashiers and notifying to open a new checkout desk in case of the queues getting too long.

# Updated user hypotheses
Based on the user interview we can update the Retail Manager part of our user hypotheses.

Retail Manager Rachel: Rachel is a retail store manager who is interested in optimizing her store's layout and product displays to increase sales and enhance customer experience. She is also interested in using AI driven solutions for improving the security of her stores by enhancing the process of detecting and handling theft. She is in her late 30s, with a background in business management, and has experience in retail sales. Rachel is interested in using VigilHeat to analyze customer behavior and interactions with different products to determine which items are generating the most interest or attention. She would also make use of VigilHeat in case of theft by detecting the exact time an item disappeared and being able to follow the route a potential thief has taken through the store. She values data-driven insights to improve business operations and achieve sales goals.
