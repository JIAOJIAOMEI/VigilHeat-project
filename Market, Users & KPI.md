# User KPI Definition

**For the VigilHeat project, several user KPIs can be defined to measure its effectiveness**:

1. Detection Accuracy: This KPI measures the accuracy of VigilHeat's HOI models in detecting human-object interactions in surveillance footage. It can be calculated by comparing the number of correctly detected interactions to the total number of interactions in a given timeframe. This KPI can be measured and presented through performance reports that show the number of correct detections, false positives, and false negatives over time.
2. Response Time: This KPI measures the response time of VigilHeat in detecting and alerting security personnel to potential incidents in real-time. It can be calculated by measuring the time elapsed between the detection of a potential incident and the alerting of security personnel. This KPI can be measured and presented through performance reports that show the average response time over a given timeframe.
3. Efficiency: This KPI measures the efficiency of VigilHeat in detecting and analyzing surveillance footage. It can be calculated by measuring the number of surveillance footage streams that VigilHeat can analyze simultaneously. This KPI can be measured and presented through performance reports that show the number of streams analyzed simultaneously over a given timeframe.
4. User Satisfaction: This KPI measures the satisfaction level of VigilHeat's users. It can be calculated by conducting user surveys and measuring user satisfaction scores. This KPI can be measured and presented through user satisfaction reports that show the average satisfaction score over a given timeframe.

These KPIs can be calculated and measured through the use of performance monitoring and analysis tools. Performance reports and user satisfaction reports can be generated to present the KPIs in a provable way. For example, performance reports can show graphs and charts that illustrate the number of correct detections, false positives, and false negatives over time. User satisfaction reports can show graphs and charts that illustrate user satisfaction scores over time. These reports can be shared with stakeholders to demonstrate the effectiveness of VigilHeat in achieving its goals and objectives.

**From the users' perspective, the effectiveness of VigilHeat can also be measured by specific KPIs**:

For Retail Manager Rachel, a possible user KPI could be the average sales conversion rate per customer. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of sales by the total number of customers, measured over a period of time (e.g. a day, a week, a month). This KPI can be measured by comparing the conversion rate before and after implementing VigilHeat's insights on product displays and layout optimization.

For Manufacturing Engineer Mark, a possible user KPI could be the average time taken to complete a production cycle. This can be calculated by measuring the time taken to complete a full production cycle, from start to finish, and averaging it over multiple cycles. This KPI can be measured by comparing the production cycle time before and after implementing VigilHeat's insights on workflow optimization and safety hazard identification.

For Condominium Manager Catherine, a possible user KPI could be the number of reported security incidents per month. This can be calculated by tracking the number of security incidents reported each month, such as car theft or unauthorized entry, and comparing it before and after implementing VigilHeat's real-time alert system. The KPI can be presented in a provable way by showing the decrease in the number of reported incidents after implementing VigilHeat's real-time alert system.

While these user KPIs are basic, they can be used to measure the effectiveness of VigilHeat's insights and its impact on the users' business operations.

# Target User KPI

For the VigilHeat project, the target user KPIs will depend on the specific needs and goals of each user persona. However, some possible targets for the user KPIs could be:

- Retail Manager Rachel: Increase sales conversion rate by 5% within 3 months of implementing VigilHeat's insights on product displays and layout optimization.
- Manufacturing Engineer Mark: Reduce production cycle time by 10% within 6 months of implementing VigilHeat's insights on workflow optimization and safety hazard identification.
- Condominium Manager Catherine: Reduce the number of reported security incidents by 20% within 3 months of implementing VigilHeat's real-time alert system.

It is important to note that these target user KPIs are not guaranteed and may not be achievable in all cases. They are simply intended as realistic goals for the users to work towards with the help of VigilHeat's insights and data-driven recommendations. The actual results may vary depending on various factors such as the user's current business operations, market conditions, and external factors beyond VigilHeat's control. Nonetheless, by setting these targets and working towards achieving them, the users can strive to improve their operations, increase productivity, and enhance security measures with the help of VigilHeat's advanced computer vision and machine learning capabilities.
